For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome.\nThe LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information.\nI am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.\nNow, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed. ",

Here are the highlights of the discussion:\n\nWe have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.\nAll the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)\nProject 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)\nWe had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.\n\nAll of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:\nProject 1 deadline will NOT be changed.\nPlease make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.\nKind regards\nTDS Team",

    "content": "@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand\nWe truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here -\n\n\nWhy is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course not as a full-time student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.\n\n\nWeek 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.\n\n\nProject help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.\n\n\nThank you.",

    "content": "Hi Hari,\nThe goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\nHave you watched this session in particular?\n\n\n\n\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\n\n\n\n\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\n\n\n\n\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\nKind regards",

    "content": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.",

    "content": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\n\n\nIsolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\n\n\nReproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\n\n\nPortability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n\n• Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\n\nUsing requirements.txt\n\n• Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n• If you don’t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n• If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\nHandling Version Conflicts\n• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n• Using greater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\nBest Practices Summary\n\nAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\nUse a requirements.txt file for reproducibility.\nPin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\nPeriodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\n\nKind regards",

    "content": "For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.\nWhereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.\n\nFor project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement\n\n\n\n\n\n 24f2006531:\n\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?\n\n\nComing to your second question,\nThe first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt.\n\n\n\n\n 24f2006531:\n\nMy understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation\n\n\nThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.\n\nNever try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, pip3 freeze > requirements.txt . This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you\n",

    "content": "Hi manmeet,\nI don’t know about solution to this.\nSome network setting might be causing problem.\nAlternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month.
